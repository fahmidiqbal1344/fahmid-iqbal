    "intro": "I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of North Texas, working under the supervision of Dr. Sagnik Ray Choudhury. My research lies in Natural Language Processing, with a primary focus on understanding and improving the generalization of NLP models across diverse dimensions. In particular, I study model behavior in terms of reasoning capabilities, robustness to distributional shifts, and interpretability. Through systematic evaluation and analysis, my work aims to move beyond surface-level accuracy toward deeper insights into how and why NLP models succeed or fail."
